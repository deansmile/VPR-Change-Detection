# Grounding DINO model (tiny variant)

The Grounding DINO model was proposed in [Grounding DINO: Marrying DINO with Grounded Pre-Training for Open-Set Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499) by Shilong Liu, Zhaoyang Zeng, Tianhe Ren, Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Jie Yang, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Lei Zhang. Grounding DINO extends a closed-set object detection model with a text encoder, enabling open-set object detection. The model achieves remarkable results, such as 52.5 AP on COCO zero-shot.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for zero-shot object detection (the task of detecting things in an image out-of-the-box without labeled data).

### How to use

Here's how to use the model for zero-shot object detection:

```python
import requests

import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForZeroShotObjectDetection 

model_id = "IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny"
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForZeroShotObjectDetection.from_pretrained(model_id).to(device)

image_url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw)
# Check for cats and remote controls
# VERY important: text queries need to be lowercased + end with a dot
text = "a cat. a remote control."

inputs = processor(images=image, text=text, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

results = processor.post_process_grounded_object_detection(
    outputs,
    inputs.input_ids,
    box_threshold=0.4,
    text_threshold=0.3,
    target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]]
)
```
