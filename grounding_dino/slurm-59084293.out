  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of groundingdino==0.1.0 from file:///scratch/ds5725/alvpr/Robust-Scene-Change-Detection/grounding_dino (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.
